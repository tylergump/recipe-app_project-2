The general idea of this app is to provide a forum for cooking enthusiasts to share recipes and interact with each other about all things cooking.


MVP Goals
-As a user, I want to first be presented a landing page with the option to log in, sign up, go to the About page, or go to the core Recipes page.
-As a user, I’ll need to create an account in order to navigate to the Recipes page.
-As a user, I’ll be presented a list of recipes submitted by users, showing the recipe name, picture, and author name
-As a user, clicking a recipe takes me to its show page showing the recipe name, pic, ingredients, and recipe steps
-There’ll also be a button towards the bottom of the page allowing users to leave a comment
-As a user, I’ll be presented a basic form on the comments page, which upon submitting, will direct me back to the recipe show page with my comment now displayed at the bottom

Stretch Goals
-There will be a button towards the bottom of the recipe show page allowing users to leave a comment
-As a user, I’ll be presented a basic form on the comments page, which upon submitting, will direct me back to the recipe show page with my comment now displayed at the bottom (along with any others previously submitted)
-As a user, I will also be presented with a “Community” button on the Home/landing page
-As a user, clicking that button will direct me to a traditional forum-style page where users can post things not directly related to a recipe (e.g. a tip they learned from their grandmother, a review of a kitchen appliance, restaurant recommendations)
-As a user, the comments section will have a star system and will display the average of all star grades for each recipe
